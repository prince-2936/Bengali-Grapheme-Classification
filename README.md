# Bengali-Grapheme-Classification
Deep Learning is a very powerful field today. It could be used to solve various problems which were not
possible earlier. In this project I am going to implement some deep learning models to classify Bengali
grapheme. It is very less touch problem. Moreover Bengali is the 5th highest spoken language. Solution
of this problem has various applications. Technology is only useful if we can make our society better with
it.
