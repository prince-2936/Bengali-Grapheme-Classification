# Bengali-Grapheme-Classification
Bengali is the 5th most spoken language in the world with hundreds of millions of speakers. It’s the official language of Bangladesh and the second most spoken language in India. Considering its reach, there’s significant business and educational interest in developing AI that can optically recognize images of the language handwritten. This challenge hopes to improve on approaches to Bengali recognition. Optical character recognition is particularly challenging for Bengali. While Bengali has 49 letters (to be more specific 11 vowels and 38 consonants) in its alphabet, there are also 18 potential diacritics, or accents. This means that there are many more graphemes, or the smallest units in a written language. The added complexity results in ~13,000 different grapheme variations (compared to English’s 250 graphemic units). Advancement in the technology will help in solving this problem. There is a lot of good architectures and models to try for this task. There is a lot of worked required in this language. There is a lot of potential for improvement. A grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system for any language. The definition of grapheme for English is tied to how phonemes are defined/spoken.
